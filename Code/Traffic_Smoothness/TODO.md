# SSA optimization TODO

- [ ] Populate load_traffic_data() parsing with your datasetâ€™s exact fields
- [ ] Adjust LOWER_BOUND/UPPER_BOUND to realistic signal timings, routing options, detour flags
- [ ] Tune fitness-function weights to balance average delay, throughput, and bottleneck penalties
- [ ] Find/Add dataset
- [] Make the code more efficient and scalable
- [] Make first model more of a simulation before trying to use a dataset first
