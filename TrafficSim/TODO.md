# SSA Simulation TODO
- [ ] Implement SSA algorithm for optimization
- [ ] Tune SSA parameters for optimal Simulation performance
- [ ] Evaluate SSA results against baseline methods
- [ ] implement finding the path of lease resistance/optimal route with multiple vehicles and multiple routes and multiple time windows and multiple scenarios
- [ ] use discrete SSA
